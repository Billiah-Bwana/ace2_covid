## Background

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the continents. While the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in Africa has been reported to be lower than other continents, the Malaria rate in Africa is higher than in the non-African population. ACE2 plays a role in Malaria and COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 enzyme to enter host cells, while downregulation of ACE2 leads to accumulation of angiotensin II substrate, which impairs Plasmodium development and thus has a protective effect in Malaria. Although the difference in COVID-19 incidence can be explained by many factors such as low testing capacity in Africa, the variable distribution of the ACE2 gene has been linked to this observed phenomenon. Little is known about ACE2 expression in African COVID-19 patients compared to non-African COVID-19 patients.

## Methods
In this study, transcriptomes from African and non-African COVID-19 patients were downloaded from the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) and analyzed for ACE2 gene expression. The reads were aligned to the human reference genome using HISAT2 and the raw counts generated using HTseq-count. EdgeR was used to conduct differential gene expression analysis with statistical analysis being done in R.
