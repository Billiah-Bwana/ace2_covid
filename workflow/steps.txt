Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]
.Raw reads download from NCBI
.Quality check (fastqc)
.Trimming and cleaning of fastq files (cutadapt)
.Alignment to human reference genome - hg38 (HISAT2)
.Convert SAM files to BAM files (samtools)
.Sort BAM files (samtools)
.Alignment to human reference genome - hg38 (HISAT2)
.Count reads associated with each gene (HTSeq-count)
.Raw counts
.Differential gene expression analysis + generate list of differentially expressed genes (EdgeR)
.Statistical analysis in R / compare between populations
